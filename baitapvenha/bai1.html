    <h1> I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>
    <p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. when the sun is shining <br> 
        and the air is warn, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an <br>
         impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.</p>
    <p>there are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
    <p>* I get lots of exercise</p>
    <p>* I enjoy the freedom </p>
    <p>* I have an opportunity to be in the sun. </p>
